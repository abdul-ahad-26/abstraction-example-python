# Abstraction in Python 🐍

This is a simple demo of **Abstraction** using Python's `abc` module and `@abstractmethod`.

🔹 Defines an abstract class `BankApp`  
🔹 Includes one concrete method and one abstract method  
🔹 Enforces implementation in subclasses

### 💡 Concept
Abstraction hides implementation details and enforces structure, making code cleaner and more secure.
